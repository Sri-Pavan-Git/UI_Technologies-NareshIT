  <h1> How to Set an ICON to a web page </h1>
  <p> Alike "Title", "ICON" should not change for every page.</p><br/>
  <p> We uses link tag for setting an ICON for the pge we have to use this link tag for every page, but should not change the file e are refering for the link tag.If we observe in any webpages the title of the page will change form page to page but the ICON for the web site will not chage. For ICON is the same for all the web pages</P>
  <p>Coming to link tag usage. We can use the link tag for two purposes one is setting the ICON for a web site and the another is setting styles. By mentioning in the "rel" attribute we can use link tag as we want.</p>
  <h3><u>Attributes</u></h3>
  <p>We uses rel, href attributes</p>
  <h4>rel</h4>
  <p>By giving value "icon" to this attribute, we can use link tag for setting ICON.</p>
  <h4>href</h4>
  <p>Here we can mention the address of the file that we are using for our icon. This allows so many type of files like .ico, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .tiff</p>
